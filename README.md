The trivia game!

There are 4 questions that are prompted once the file has loaded (index.html) 

Objective: Answer all the questions before the timer runs out, at the bottom of the page there will be a submit button. After you answer all the questions click the button and you will be given a score at the end. If you dont finish in time the game will end and give you your score for the amount of questions you answered even if you have not hit sumbit. Good luck!


-------NOTE: The most challenging part for me was actually figuring out how to submit automatically after the timer runs out. I couldnt figure out how. I feel like I am close, will take a look on how to do it soon or ask one of the TA's.--------
